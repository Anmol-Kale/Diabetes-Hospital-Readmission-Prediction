# Diabetes-Hospital-Readmission-Prediction
A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital, gets re-admitted after diagnosed with the same problem within a certain period in our case it is within 30 days of discharge.
Readmission rates for a hospital reflects the quality of its healthcare delivery. Under the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decrease payments to hospitals that have greater than expected 30-day readmission rates.
Our objective is to determine the factors that influence the readmission of a diabetes patient and accordingly predict the patients whose chances of getting readmitted to the hospital (within 30 days are higher)
